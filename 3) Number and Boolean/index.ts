// Number

//* bad code ( as typescript is smart enough to know that this is a number)
//this also leads to reduntant code but there are some cases where mentioning a type is must
// let userId:Number = 334466.233

// good code
let userId = 334466.233

// Boolean
let isLoggedIn:Boolean = false

export {}
